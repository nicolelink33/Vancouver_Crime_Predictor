# Raw Data

This folder contains the raw, unprocessed crime data downloaded from Kaggle.

## Files
- `crimedata.csv` - Raw crime data from Vancouver Police Department (2003-2017)
- `crimedata.zip` - Compressed version of the raw data

## Note
The raw data files are generated by running `scripts/download_data.py` and are not tracked in git due to their size.
